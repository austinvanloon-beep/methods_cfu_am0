# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

- I am most proud of understanding git commands as much as i do right now as they were scary to learn at first.
- to be able to reuse code (save time) and improved readability, in addition to testing.
